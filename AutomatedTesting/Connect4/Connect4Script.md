# Connect 4 Game

Welcome to the Connect 4 game! This project is a fully functional Connect 4 game developed using Python and Pygame. Player 1 is human-controlled, while Player 2 is powered by an AI using the minimax algorithm.


## Prerequisites
To run the game locally, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

### Step 1: Install Python
Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Step 2: Install Pygame
Open your command line interface and run the following command:
```sh
pip install pygame

```
### Step 3: Copy the full Connect 4 Script Directly from my Github Repository

Copy the Connect4 Script from [here](https://github.com/benvdm03/Infinity/tree/main/AutomatedTesting) and paste the full script into your local VSCode or equivalent. 

### Step 4: Run the Game and Enjoy!

The functionality of the game will automatically keep track of your progress against the AI, so best of luck! My personal record is somewhere in the realm of 5 wins to 40 losses against the MiniMax Algorithm. Hopefully you can do better!
